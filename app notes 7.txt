5.	The captain of a cricket team of 11 members is 26 years old and the wicket keeper is 3 years older. If the ages of these two are excluded, the average age of the remaining players is one year less than the average age of the whole team. What is the average age of the team?
	A.	23 years
	B.	24 years	
	C.	25 years
	D.	None of these
Your Answer: Option B
Correct Answer: Option A
Explanation:
Let the average age of the whole team by x years.
 11x - (26 + 29) = 9(x -1)
 11x - 9x = 46
 2x = 46
 x = 23.
So, average age of the team is 23 years.

10.	A starts business with Rs. 3500 and after 5 months, B joins with A as his partner. After a year, the profit is divided in the ratio 2 : 3. What is B's contribution in the capital?
	A.	Rs. 7500
	B.	Rs. 8000	
	C.	Rs. 8500
	D.	Rs. 9000
Your Answer: Option B
Correct Answer: Option D
Explanation:
Let B's capital be Rs. x.
Then,		3500 x 12	=	2	
7x	3
 14x = 126000

 x = 9000.
 
3.A wheel that has 6 cogs is meshed with a larger wheel of 14 cogs. When the smaller wheel has made 21 revolutions, then the number of revolutions mad by the larger wheel is:
	A.	4
	B.	9
	C.	12	
	D.	49
Your Answer: Option C
Correct Answer: Option B
Explanation:
Let the required number of revolutions made by larger wheel be x.
Then, More cogs, Less revolutions (Indirect Proportion)
 14 : 6 :: 21 : x        14 x x = 6 x 21
 x =	6 x 21
14
 x = 9.

15.	A train 240 m long passes a pole in 24 seconds. How long will it take to pass a platform 650 m long?
	A.	65 sec
	B.	89 sec
	C.	100 sec	
	D.	150 sec
Your Answer: Option C
Correct Answer: Option B
Explanation:
Speed =		240	m/sec = 10 m/sec.
24
 Required time =		240 + 650	sec = 89 sec.

18.	A boatman goes 2 km against the current of the stream in 1 hour and goes 1 km along the current in 10 minutes. How long will it take to go 5 km in stationary water?
	A.	40 minutes
	B.	1 hour	
	C.	1 hr 15 min
	D.	1 hr 30 min
Your Answer: Option B
Correct Answer: Option C
Explanation:
Rate downstream =		1	x 60	km/hr = 6 km/hr.
10
Rate upstream = 2 km/hr.
Speed in still water =	1	(6 + 2) km/hr = 4 km/hr.
2
 Required time =		5	hrs = 1	1	hrs = 1 hr 15 min.

19.	8 litres are drawn from a cask full of wine and is then filled with water. This operation is performed three more times. The ratio of the quantity of wine now left in cask to that of water is 16 : 65. How much wine did the cask hold originally?
	A.	18 litres	
	B.	24 litres
	C.	32 litres
	D.	42 litres
Your Answer: Option A
Correct Answer: Option B
Explanation:
Let the quantity of the wine in the cask originally be x litres.
Then, quantity of wine left in cask after 4 operations =		x		1 -	8		4	 litres.
x
		x(1 - (8/x))4		=	16
x	81
		1 -	8		4	=		2		4
x	3
		x - 8		=	2
x	3
 3x - 24 = 2x
 x = 24.
 
20.A bag contains 2 red, 3 green and 2 blue balls. Two balls are drawn at random. What is the probability that none of the balls drawn is blue?
	A.	10/21
	B.	11/21
	C.	2/7
	D.	5/7
Your Answer: Option B
Correct Answer: Option A
Explanation:
Total number of balls = (2 + 3 + 2) = 7.
Let S be the sample space.
Then, n(S)	= Number of ways of drawing 2 balls out of 7
= 7C2 `
=	(7 x 6)
(2 x 1)
= 21.
Let E = Event of drawing 2 balls, none of which is blue.

 n(E)	= Number of ways of drawing 2 balls out of (2 + 3) balls.
= 5C2
=	(5 x 4)
(2 x 1)
= 10.
 P(E) =	n(E)	=	10	.
n(S)	21
