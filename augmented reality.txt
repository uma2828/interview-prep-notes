AUGMENTED REALITY – INTRODUCTION AND ITS REAL WORLD USES
      Augmented reality is a technology that works on computer vision based recognition algorithms to augment sound, video, graphics and other sensor based inputs
on real world objects using the camera of your device.
	   Real world + Virtual image = Augmented reality
	   ex: Movie Endiran.
	   
Real-World Examples
AR applications can become the backbone of the education industry. Apps are being developed which embed text, images, and videos, as well as real–world curriculums.
Printing and advertising industries are developing apps to display digital content on top of real world magazines.
With the help of Unity 3d Engine, AR is being used to develop real-time 3D Games.

Components of AR:
Head-mounted
A head-mounted display (HMD) is a display device paired to a headset such as a harness or helmet. 
HMDs place images of both the physical world and virtual objects over the user's field of view.

Contact lenses
Contact lenses that display AR imaging are in development. 

Handheld
Handheld displays employ a small display that fits in a user's hand. All handheld AR solutions to date opt for video see-through.

Applications:
Art
Commerce
Education
Gaming
Medicine

How does Augmented Reality work?
AR can be displayed on various devices: screens, glasses, handheld devices, mobile phones, head-mounted displays. It involves technologies like S.L.A.M. 
(simultaneous localization and mapping), depth tracking (briefly, a sensor data calculating the distance to the objects), and the following components:
Cameras and sensors: Collecting data about user’s interactions and sending it for processing.
