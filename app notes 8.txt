1.	The product of two numbers is 2028 and their H.C.F. is 13. The number of such pairs is:
	A.	1
	B.	2
	C.	3	
	D.	4
Your Answer: Option C
Correct Answer: Option B
Explanation:
Let the numbers 13a and 13b.
Then, 13a x 13b = 2028
 ab = 12.
Now, the co-primes with product 12 are (1, 12) and (3, 4).

[Note: Two integers a and b are said to be coprime or relatively prime if they have no common positive factor other than 1 or, equivalently, if their greatest common divisor is 1 ]

So, the required numbers are (13 x 1, 13 x 12) and (13 x 3, 13 x 4).

Clearly, there are 2 such pairs.

4.	The sum of the digits of a two-digit number is 15 and the difference between the digits is 3. What is the two-digit number?
	A.	69
	B.	78
	C.	96	
	D.	Cannot be determined
	E.	None of these
Your Answer: Option C
Correct Answer: Option D
Explanation:
Let the ten's digit be x and unit's digit be y.

Then, x + y = 15 and x - y = 3   or   y - x = 3.

Solving x + y = 15   and   x - y = 3, we get: x = 9, y = 6.

Solving x + y = 15   and   y - x = 3, we get: x = 6, y = 9.

So, the number is either 96 or 69.

Hence, the number cannot be determined.

5.	A number consists of two digits. If the digits interchange places and the new number is added to the original number, then the resulting number will be divisible by:
	A.	3
	B.	5
	C.	9	
	D.	11
Your Answer: Option C
Correct Answer: Option D
Explanation:
Let the ten's digit be x and unit's digit be y.
Then, number = 10x + y.

Number obtained by interchanging the digits = 10y + x.

8.	A 270 metres long train running at the speed of 120 kmph crosses another train running in opposite direction at the speed of 80 kmph in 9 seconds. What is the length of the other train?
	A.	230 m
	B.	240 m
	C.	260 m	
	D.	320 m
	E.	None of these
Your Answer: Option C
Correct Answer: Option A
Explanation:
Relative speed = (120 + 80) km/hr

   =		200 x	5	m/sec
18
   =		500	m/sec.
9
Let the length of the other train be x metres.

Then,	x + 270	=	500
9	9
 x + 270 = 500

 x = 230.
 
9.	A train 108 m long moving at a speed of 50 km/hr crosses a train 112 m long coming from opposite direction in 6 seconds. The speed of the second train is:
	A.	48 km/hr
	B.	54 km/hr	
	C.	66 km/hr
	D.	82 km/hr
Your Answer: Option B
Correct Answer: Option D
Explanation:
Let the speed of the second train be x km/hr.
Relative speed	= (x + 50) km/hr
=	[	(x + 50) x	5	]	m/sec
18
=	[	250 + 5x	]	m/sec.
18
Distance covered = (108 + 112) = 220 m.

Therefore	220	= 6
(	250 + 5x	(
18
=> 250 + 5x = 660

=> x = 82 km/hr.

11.	Which of the following statements is not correct?
	A.	log10 10 = 1
	B.	log (2 + 3) = log (2 x 3)
	C.	log10 1 = 0	
	D.	log (1 + 2 + 3) = log 1 + log 2 + log 3
Your Answer: Option C
Correct Answer: Option B
Explanation:
(a) Since loga a = 1, so log10 10 = 1.

(b) log (2 + 3) = log 5 and log (2 x 3) = log 6 = log 2 + log 3

      log (2 + 3)  log (2 x 3)

(c) Since loga 1 = 0, so log10 1 = 0.

(d) log (1 + 2 + 3) = log 6 = log (1 x 2 x 3) = log 1 + log 2 + log 3.

So, (b) is incorrect.

15.	A can run 22.5 m while B runs 25 m. In a kilometre race B beats A by:
	A.	100 m
	B.	111	1	m9
	C.	25 m	
	D.	50 m
Your Answer: Option C
Correct Answer: Option A
Explanation:

When B runs 25 m, A runs	45	m.
2
When B runs 1000 m, A runs		45	x	1	x 1000	m	= 900 m.
2	25
 B beats A by 100 m.
 
 17.In a box, there are 8 red, 7 blue and 6 green balls. One ball is picked up randomly. What is the probability that it is neither red nor green?
	A.	1/3
	B.	3/4
	C.	7/19
	D.	8/21
	E.	9/21
Your Answer: Option D
Correct Answer: Option A
Explanation:
Total number of balls = (8 + 7 + 6) = 21.

Let E	= event that the ball drawn is neither red nor green
= event that the ball drawn is blue.
 n(E) = 7.

 P(E) =	n(E)	=	7	=	1	.
n(S)	21	3
