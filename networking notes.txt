Basics of Computer Networking
Open system:
A system which is connected to the network and is ready for communication.

Closed system:
A system which is not connected to the network and can’t be communicated with.

Computer Network: 
It is the interconnection of multiple devices, generally termed as Hosts connected using multiple paths for the purpose of sending/receiving data or media.

OSI:
OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection. It is a reference model that specifies standards for communications protocols and also the functionalities of each layer.
Protocol: 
Protocol is the set of rules or algorthims which define the way how two entities can communicate across the network

Host name:
Each device in the network is associated with a unique device name known as Hostname.

IP Address (Internet Protocol address):
Also know as Logical Address, is the network address of the system across the network.
MAC Address (Media Access Control address): 
Also known as physical address, is the unique identifier of each host and is associated with the NIC (Network Interface Card).

Port: 
Port can be referred as logical channel through which data can be sent/received to an application. 

DNS Server:
DNS stands for Domain Name system.
DNS is basically a server which translate web addresses or URL (ex: www.google.com) into their corresponding IP addresses

ARP:
ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol.
It is used to convert the IP address to its corresponding Physical Address(i.e.MAC Address).
ARP is used by the Data Link Layer to identify the MAC address of the Receiver’s machine.
RARP:
RARP stands for Reverse Address Resolution Protocol.
As the name suggest, it provides the IP address of the a device given physical address as input. But RARP has become obsolete since the time DHCP has come into picture.
