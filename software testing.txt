Selenium (software)
      Selenium is a portable software-testing framework for web applications. 
	  Selenium provides a playback (formerly also recording) tool for authoring tests without the need to learn a test scripting language (Selenium IDE).
	  It also provides a test including C#, Groovy, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby and Scala. The tests can then run against most modern web browsers. 
	  Selenium deploys on Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms.
	  It is open-source software, released under the Apache 2.0 license: web developers can download and use it without charge.

Components
     1. Selenium IDE	
             Selenium IDE is a complete integrated development environment (IDE) for Selenium tests. 
			 It is implemented as a Firefox Add-On and available on Chrome Store recently, and allows recording, editing, and debugging tests.
	 2. Selenium client API	
             As an alternative to writing tests in Selenese, tests can also be written in various programming languages. 
			 These tests then communicate with Selenium by calling methods in the Selenium Client API. 
			 Selenium currently provides client APIs for Java, C#, Ruby, JavaScript and Python
	 3. Selenium WebDriver	
             Selenium WebDriver is the successor to Selenium RC.
             Selenium WebDriver accepts commands (sent in Selenese, or via a Client API) and sends them to a browser.
	 4. Selenium Remote Control	
			 Selenium Remote Control (RC) is a server, written in Java, that accepts commands for the browser via HTTP.
			 RC makes it possible to write automated tests for a web application in any programming language.
	 5. Selenium Grid	Edit
			 Selenium Grid is a server that allows tests to use web browser instances running on remote machines. 
			 With Selenium Grid, one server acts as the hub.
			 
			
Software Testing - Overview
What is Testing?
    Testing is the process of evaluating a system or its component(s) with the intent to find whether it satisfies the specified requirements or not. 
     In simple words, testing is executing a system in order to identify any gaps, errors, or missing requirements in contrary to the actual requirements.
